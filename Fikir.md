# New ıdeas/Game Ideas
## Saksı Kafa
Like a month ago, a boss throw a plant to his worker. I want to make this moments game. 
- Builted with UE5
- FPS



# Old Ideas (probably i wont do them)
## 1. MpTUIv
### MusicplayerTerminal User Interface-v

A tui music player C++ software built on FTXUI. Will use mpv. Features:

- Beatiful TUI,
- Easy use,
- Will make recaps,
- Local work,
- With yt-dlp, you will be able to listen from YT-MUSIC(in the very future) too. like [`yt-x`](https://github.com/Benexl/yt-x).

## 2. /dev/*insert-number-here*
So i saw a guy on [btt forum](https://btt.community/) and he made a software that fills a disk by 1's(instead of 0's) called /dev/one so i want to made a software that you can fill an entire device with your favourite number.
