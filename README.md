- âš¡ Fun facts:
- 1st I hate MIT. Plz use gpl/gpl like licenses in your projects.
- 2nd It can look like i don't commit much but my commits worth more. I don't commit when i write a new line of code. When i add a full working function. (Sometimes it worth less like fixing a spelling mistake in README.)
