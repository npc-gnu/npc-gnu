# 👋 Hi, I'm npc-gnu!
(Real Name: Çınar Kuzey KUMANLI)

🎮 **High school student & hobby programmer on a quest to become a game director and developer.**  
Dreaming of building worlds like *Red Dead Redemption*, *The Witcher*, and *Metro*. Learning Unreal Engine 5—loving fixable bugs, hating those 5-hour-eater ones.

- 🌱 Always learning, always dreaming
